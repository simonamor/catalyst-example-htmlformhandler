What is this?
=============

This is an example application to work out how to use HTML::FormHandler
in conjunction with Catalyst. Perhaps later on I will include the
HTML::FormHandler::Model::DBIC functionality that interfaces with a
DBIx::Class schema.

How to use it
=============

Install the dependencies listed in the Makefile.PL

Run script/forms_server.pl to test the application.

Visit http://localhost:3000/ (remember to adjust the URL if you change
the port number or run it on a machine other than your local machine).
